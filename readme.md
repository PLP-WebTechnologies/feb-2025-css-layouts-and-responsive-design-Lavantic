I've created a responsive webpage that implements both Flexbox and CSS Grid layouts with media queries for different screen sizes. Here's a breakdown of what I included:
Layout Implementation:

Flexbox is used for:

Navigation bar layout
Service section with flexible boxes
Footer content arrangement


CSS Grid is used for:

Feature cards in a responsive grid


Responsive Design with Media Queries:

Desktop (default): 3-column layout for features and services
Tablet (max-width: 768px): 2-column layout and hamburger menu navigation
Mobile (max-width: 480px): Single column layout with stacked elements



Key Components:

Navigation Bar: Sticky navigation with mobile hamburger menu toggle
Hero Section: Full-width intro section
Features Section: Using CSS Grid for layout
Services Section: Using Flexbox for layout
Footer: Multi-column responsive footer

Responsive Features:

The hamburger menu appears on tablet and mobile sizes
Grid columns reduce as screen size decreases
Font sizes and spacing adjust for smaller screens
Footer layout changes to stack vertically on mobile

The page is designed to be visually appealing with consistent spacing, color scheme, and typography while demonstrating proper implementation of both layout techniques.
